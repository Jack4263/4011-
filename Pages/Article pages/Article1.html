        Goal 2 is about creating a world free of hunger by 2030.The global issue
        of hunger and food insecurity has shown an alarming increase since 2015,
        a trend exacerbated by a combination of factors including the pandemic,
        conflict, climate change, and deepening inequalities.
      </p>
      <p>
        By 2022, approximately 735 million people – or 9.2% of the world’s
        population – found themselves in a state of chronic hunger – a
        staggering rise compared to 2019. This data underscores the severity of
        the situation, revealing a growing crisis.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, an estimated 2.4 billion people faced moderate to severe
        food insecurity in 2022. This classification signifies their lack of
        access to sufficient nourishment. This number escalated by an alarming
        391 million people compared to 2019.
      </p>
      <p>
        The persistent surge in hunger and food insecurity, fueled by a complex
        interplay of factors, demands immediate attention and coordinated global
        efforts to alleviate this critical humanitarian challenge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Extreme hunger and malnutrition remains a barrier to sustainable
        development and creates a trap from which people cannot easily escape.
        Hunger and malnutrition mean less productive individuals, who are more
        prone to disease and thus often unable to earn more and improve their
        livelihoods.
      </p>

      <p>
        2 billion people in the world do not have reg- ular access to safe,
        nutritious and sufficient food. In 2022, 148 million children had
        stunted growth and 45 million children under the age of 5 were affected
        by wasting.

          <h3>How many people are hungry?</h3>
          <p>
            It is projected that more than 600 million people worldwide will be
            facing hunger in 2030, highlighting the immense challenge of
            achieving the zero hunger target.
          </p>
          <p>
            People experiencing moderate food insecurity are typically unable to
            eat a healthy, balanced diet on a regular basis because of income or
            other resource constraints.

          <h3>Why are there so many hungry people?</h3>
          <p>
            Shockingly, the world is back at hunger levels not seen since 2005,
            and food prices remain higher in more countries than in the period
            2015–2019. Along with conflict, climate shocks, and rising cost of
            living, civil insecurity and declining food production have all
            contributed to food scarcity and high food prices.
          </p>
          <p>
            Investment in the agriculture sector is critical for reducing hunger
            and poverty, improving food security, creating employment and
            building resilience to disasters and shocks.
